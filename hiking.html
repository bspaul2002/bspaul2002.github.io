		<h3>Mt. Hollywood Trail</h3>
		<p>This trail was very hard for me because it was really hot outside so I got pretty burnt. It is very easy to get dehydrated if you are out in the sun for long, so I had to make sure I was drinking enoigh water throughout the trail.</p>

		<h3>Fairyland Loop Trail</h3>
		<p>This trail was of my favorite trails. The views were breakthtaking, it felt like I was on mars! However, it was a little but hard because the gravel was slippery to walk on. This trail also had no shade, so I had to be careful with the sun burning my skin.</p>

		<h3>Angels Landing Trail</h3>
		<p>This trail was pretty scary. At times, it was very narrow. The narrowest portion of the trail was only a few feet wide. My legs were burning at the end of this trail and the adrenaline rush was crazy!</p>
