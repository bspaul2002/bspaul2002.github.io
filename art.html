		<h3>Study of Three Hands by Albrecht Durer</h3>
		<p>I drew this with charcoal pencils. The difference between charcoal pencils and regular pencils is that charcoal is crumbly and powdery in texture, making it easier to blend.</p>

		<h3>Costa Rican Sunset</h3>
		<p>I painted this using mainly shades of blue, orange, and purple. The part that was especially hard for me to recreate were the leaves on the palm trees. This is because there were a lot of leaves in the picutre and the strokes had to be small and precise.</p>

		<p>This painting was based off of a picture I took while visiting Costa Rica. I was inspired by the vibrant colors of this sunset. This painting is meant to give off feelings of calmness and tranquility.</p>

		<h3>Still Life</h3>
		<p>I drew this still life with charcoal pencils, however, you can see that the technique with this drawing is different from the technique with the Durer drawing. These differences are due to a tool called blending stumps. A blending stump is usually made of rolled paper and makes smudging charcoal a lot smoother and easier for artists.</p>

		<p>A still life depicts inanimate objects. For this piece, my art teacher collected a number of bottles of all different sizes. We would draw what we saw from where we were sitting in the room. </p>
